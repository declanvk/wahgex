                <h2>WHAT</h2>
                <p>
                    WAHGEX is a regular expression engine that compiles the
                    regex into a WebAssembly (WASM) module instead of executing
                    it directly. The output WASM module can be passed to a
                    variety of engines, such as the Web platform,
                    <a href="https://wasmtime.dev/" target="_blank">Wasmtime</a
                    >, or
                    <a
                        href="https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi"
                        target="_blank"
                        >wasmi</a
                    >.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Visit the WAHGEX
                    <a href="./playground.html" target="_blank">playground</a>
                    for an example application which uses the WASM modules to
                    execute regex on an input haystack.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project is still a work in progress, and several
                    features are currently missing:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Reporting captures or even offsets of the overall match
                        within the haystack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Better library integration with specific WASM engines
                        like Wasmtime or wasmi. Currently, it requires more
                        manual setup.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Better optimization of the output WASM code.<sup

                        >
                    </li>
                    <li>Benchmarks...</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>WHY</h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly for fun and for the chance to work with tools that
                    interested me. I've been interested in WASM for a while and
                    have a lingering interest in compilers from my time in
                    college. I also used this project as an opportunity to
                    experiment with programming using LLMs, though that part was
                    a middling success.

                <p id="fn1">
                    <a href="#r1">[1]</a> WASM engines have a different profile
                    of optimization passes (if any), since they might assume
                    that their input WASM module has come from another
                    optimizing compiler like LLVM, or at least passed through an
                    optimizer like <code>wasm-opt</code>. See

                    >
                    for some discussion about which optimization passes are
                    present in Wasmtime and which ones are present in the
                    expected upstream.
